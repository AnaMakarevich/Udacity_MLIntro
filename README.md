# Introduction to Machine Learning (Udacity)

This repository supports Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning course (a part of DAND extracurricular materials). If you're working on this course, you might want to use the updated files for the mini-projects that I adapted for Python3 (the course instructors use Python2.7). Or (a better idea), you might want to simply download the Jupyter notebook and tools folder and experiment in the notebook. Enjoy! :)
